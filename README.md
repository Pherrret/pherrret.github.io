# Programming Portfolio
Hello! My name is Jameson, and I'm a Chicago-based Game Design student at Columbia College. I've loved the art of game design since I was seven, and it's been my lifelong dream to work in this field. On the technical side of things, I gravitated towards programming because it's the skillset that lets you toy with the nitty gritty of how a game feels. How far a jump goes, how enemies spwawn, and physics systems all are dually held responsible by designers and programmers. 
This portfolio was started for a class in my freshman year, but I hope it also becomes a jumping off point to showcase my creations and what I'm currently working on, maybe before a more offical showcase on my itch page.
