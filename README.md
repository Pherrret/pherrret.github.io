# Programming Portfolio
Hello! My name is Jameson, and I'm a Chicago-based Game Design student at Columbia College. I've loved the art of game design since I was seven, and it's been my lifelong dream to work in this field. On the technical side of things, I gravitated towards programming because it's the skillset that lets you toy with the nitty gritty of how a game feels. How far a jump goes, how enemies spwawn, and physics systems all are dually held responsible by designers and programmers. 
This portfolio was started for a class in my freshman year, but I hope it also becomes a jumping off point to showcase my creations and what I'm currently working on, maybe before a more offical showcase on my itch page. 

# Project 3: Direct Source
I came up with this idea because I've been (sadly) following poltics pretty closely over the past year or so. As I've gotten more dialed in on where I get my information from, I was thinking about how it would be great to have this kind of curated hub of the streams of information coming out of the three branches of government. It also was a good way to learn about RSS feeds, which I had heard of before but never implemented into my code directly.

# Composition Creator 3.0
This was the final version of one of the first projects we did, and I was really happy where I went with mine. I turned mine from a collection of random images into a cooking process that baked, boiled, and then gave a title to some nondescript dish using a bunch of really rudimentary if statements and internal variables going up and down. Still a fun implementation of an idea especially early in the class

# Code Converter
This was one of the first times we really got a chance to dive into CSS, and it was great being able to put this fun hacker-style theme into place. The converter itself worked, but didn't do anything past the tutorial.

# Rubber Duck Guessing Game (JavaScript)
The two things that excited me about this project were that it was the first implementation of a game and the fun duck drawing. Even if the game was simple, having a repeatable script that checks player imput was fun to work with. I had an idea to improve the game a bit and make it more interactive, but I never got around to implimenting it. Then the drawing was just a lot of fun to be silly with.

# RGB Breadboard
This program was a lot of fun. I didn't do any groundbreaking work with this project, just added a few more lights than the tutorial told me to, but I really enjoyed organizing the wires and connectors. I've only barely dabbled in physical anythings, with most of my work being on software and programs, so this reminded me there's whole other worlds out there to explore.
